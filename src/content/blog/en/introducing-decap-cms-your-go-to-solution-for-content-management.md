The amount of data stored in a blockchain grows as more people adopt and interact with solutions based on this technology. New contracts are constantly created, and decentralized applications are developed to explore new use cases, contributing to the enrichment of the ecosystem.

"On-Chain" data, as opposed to "Off-Chain" data, refers to information stored in a blockchain. Each time a user interacts with a blockchain and wants to make a transaction, it is validated and then stored along with others in a block added to the chain. In general, the elements of a transaction include:

As you can see, transaction data allows us to see, for example, the recipient of a transaction and the value transferred in the native token. With a bit more work, we can calculate the total number of transactions, segment them by transaction type according to the recipient, find active addresses, and perform many other interesting calculations. Depending on the blockchain, its specific design, standards, purpose, and applications, different types of data can be stored.  Not only can we study data associated with transactions, but we can also find block metadata such as numbering and creation timestamps, as well as the code of the smart contracts that have been deployed and internal transactions between contracts.

## What can On-Chain data be used for?
In addition to what has been described, On-Chain data is not just transaction records that explain activity or growth on a blockchain but can also, depending on the context and the type of application, have other interpretations, such as:

<li>Description and analysis of a blockchain and smart contracts in terms of adoption and growth.
<li> Regarding smart contracts, aspects of security, code, and specific issues associated with the specific application developed by the contract could be analyzed.
<li>Additionally, trends in specific sectors can be analyzed, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and the tokenization of real-world physical assets.

In a broader sense, these data can be used to detect and prevent fraud, identify suspicious transactions, monitor assets and addresses of interest. They can also be used to evaluate the risk of each project to make investment decisions and consider regulatory compliance matters. Understanding the transfer of value in emerging and growing economies is certainly interesting. At OnAnalytics, we believe that these data are becoming more and more relevant, and we want to create value with them.

In the field of decentralized finance, for example, blockchain technology and smart contracts are being used to facilitate loans, exchange tokens, and even provide liquidity in exchange for interest on deposits. The development of the non-fungible token (NFT) standard has given rise to applications that certify ownership of digital assets in games known as "play-to-earn games" (P2E) but also in applications for buying and selling event tickets and flight tickets. Other applications include prediction markets, betting, instant payments, transfers, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).


## A specific use of On-Chain data for a DeFi application.

<li>Determine growth and adoption. Calculate the gas fees paid by users making transactions, which are associated with contract revenue. 
<li>Estimate the adoption and retention of users interacting with the contracts that make up the application. Identify addresses that have taken out a loan, been liquidated, made a withdrawal, or repaid a loan. 
<li>Calculate the amounts lent, liquidated, withdrawn, repaid, and the total protocol debt.

In these data, multiple opportunities are hidden for proposing new solutions and adding value; anyone with some knowledge and the use of appropriate tools can access them.
